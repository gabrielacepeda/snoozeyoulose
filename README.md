# snoozeyoulose
Bad things can happen when you don't wake up to the sound of your alarm. Started by Terri Burns and Omayeli Arenyeka during AngelHack Brooklyn 2015.

You snooze, you lose is an alarm-clock and a life-destroyer all in one application. You set your alarm and if you do not wake up or press snooze too many times then it tweets, emails and/or sends text messages that detail the extent of your indolence to people you indicate.
